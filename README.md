# Microsoft Purview In A Day

Microsoft Purview In A Day is a single day event which is all about Data Governance. During the day you'll participate in different presentations, inspiration sessions and hands-on challenges. It provides a good balance between state-of-the-art theory and hands-on experience. The Purview In A Day is all about 2 challenges in which you'll be enabled with relevant concepts, and go deep in a hands-on exercises.

## What is Microsoft Purview?

Microsoft Purview is a unified data governance service that helps you manage and govern your on-premises, multi-cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) data. Easily create a holistic, up-to-date map of your data landscape with automated data discovery, sensitive data classification and end-to-end data lineage. Empower data consumers to find valuable, trustworthy data.

## :books: Preface and introduction

To understand the relevance and need of Data Governance, you might need to read below preface, to get better acquainted with the desire and requirements of a business/organisation.

### Challenge 1

During the first challenge, you'll setup the lab environment in a Azure subscription (see Azure Pass below). We will create the required resources in a `resource group` using a predefined script, and activate the Microsoft Purview service.

Once you're all set, we will create a new collection in Microsoft Purview, and connect to two resources `Microsoft SQL Database` and the `Azure Data Lake`. Once connected, we will start scanning our data sources to extract the technical metadata. We're now able to search, and further document our data model.

Next you'll learn how to create a glossary hierarchy, and import an existing term set. We will assign terms to our data sets. To finish we will explore the concept of classifications, and we will learn how to create our own custom scan rule set.

### Challenge 2

[Cedric] To be completed with a concrete explanation.

## :thinking: Prerequisites

To complete this workshow you'll need to have access to an Azure subscription, and be able to install a custom template.

- An [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with an active subscription. Note: If you don't have access to an Azure subscription, you may be able to start with a [free account](https://www.azure.com/free).
- You must have the necessary privileges within your Azure subscription to create resources, perform role assignments, register resource providers (if required), etc.
- If you have no free account, you can leverage your Azure Pass in your Azure account. Reach out to one of our coaches, and [register Azure Pass here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/offers/azure-pass/).
